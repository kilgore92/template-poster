  abstract = {Foreground object segmentation is a critical step for many image analysis tasks. While automated methods can produce high-quality results, their failures disappoint users in need of practical solutions. We propose a resource al-location framework for predicting how best to allocate a fixed budget of human annotation effort in order to collect higher quality segmentations for a given batch of images and automated methods. The framework is based on a pro-posed prediction module that estimates the quality of given algorithm-drawn segmentations. We demonstrate the value of the framework for two novel tasks related to " pulling the plug " on computer and human annotators. Specifically, we implement two systems that automatically decide, for a batch of images, when to replace 1) humans with com-puters to create coarse segmentations required to initialize segmentation tools and 2) computers with humans to create final, fine-grained segmentations. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of relying on a mix of human and computer efforts over relying on either resource alone for segmenting objects in three diverse datasets representing visible, phase contrast microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy images.},

abstract="The automatic delineation of the boundaries of organs and other anatomical structures is a key component of many medical image processing systems. In this paper we present a generic learning approach based on a novel space of segmentation features, which can be trained to predict the overlap error and Dice coefficient of an arbitrary organ segmentation without knowing the ground truth delineation. We show the regressor to be much stronger a predictor of these error metrics than the responses of Probabilistic Boosting Classifiers trained on the segmentation boundary. The presented approach not only allows us to build reliable confidence measures and fidelity checks, but also to rank several segmentation hypotheses against each other during online usage of the segmentation algorithm in clinical practice.",

  abstract  = {We introduce a boosting algorithm to improve on existing methods for deformable image registration (DIR). The proposed DIRBoost algorithm is inspired by the theory on hypothesis boosting, well known in the field of machine learning. DIRBoost utilizes a method for automatic registration error detection to obtain estimates of local registration quality. All areas detected as erroneously registered are subjected to boosting, i.e. undergo iterative registrations by employing boosting masks on both the fixed and moving image. We validated the DIRBoost algorithm on three different DIR methods (ANTS gSyn, NiftyReg, and DROP) on three independent reference datasets of pulmonary image scan pairs. DIRBoost reduced registration errors significantly and consistently on all reference datasets for each DIR algorithm, yielding an improvement of the registration accuracy by 5?34\% depending on the dataset and the registration algorithm employed.},

  abstract = {Different researchers hold different views of what the term meta-learning exactly means. The first part of this paper provides our own perspective view in which the goal is to build self-adaptive learners (i.e. learning algorithms that improve their bias dynamically through experience by accumulating meta-knowledge). The second part provides a survey of meta-learning as reported by the machine-learning literature. We find that, despite different views and research lines, a question remains constant: how can we exploit knowledge about learning (i.e. meta-knowledge) to improve the performance of learning algorithms? Clearly the answer to this question is key to the advancement of the field and continues being the subject of intensive research.},
